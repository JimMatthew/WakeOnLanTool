# WakeOnLanTool

WakeOnLanTool is a small Java application for sending Wake on Lan packets. 
After launching, you can enter a MAC address, and press send to send a WOL packet, or press save to save the MAC so it is loaded upon launch. 
Saved MAC addresses are saved in the application's directory in a file 'wol.conf'.
